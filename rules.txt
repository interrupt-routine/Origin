Key technical concepts
The detector is a photomultiplier tube. It is a vacuum tube with a series of charged plates that are sensitive to the impact of the single photon. Every impact produces a cascade of electrons which are collected and conveyed to the PC as a current in mAmps. The tube is physically constructed to operate properly within a range of 0-10^6 photon impacts per second, or counts per second, CPS. The optimal interval to obtain a clean signal is 10^5 CPS. Values above 10^6 CPS will damage the tube more or less quickly over time. [Photoelectric effect, photomultiplier tube]
The light we shine on the sample is orders of magnitude more intense than the amount of light emitted by the sample and than the amount of light the detector can withstand before burning. This means that for no reason ever should the lamp emit light of the same wavelength at which the detector is parked. If the detector is at 500, the light that leaves the lamp should be at a higher or lower wavelength (<480, >520).
It is possible to regulate the intensity (amount) of light that enters the chamber by opening or closing the slits. These are physical openings used to regulate the intensity of light we shine on the sample like a fenditure in a medieval wall. These fenditures increase the intensity of the light by allowing a broader range to enter the chamber. If we want to select and convey in the chamber some light at 300 nm, slits 1,1 will allow for the passage of everything 300+-0.5, so everything that is [299.5, 300, 300.5]. Slits 2,2 will increse the range to 300+-1, so what passes is light at [299,299.5,300,300.5,301]. The light that enters the chamber (if we assume it's constant) is almost twice as in 1,1. Slits can reach values up to 15-16, after which they cease to make sense because there is too little control on the wavelength (slits of 20 would allow for the passage of everything between 290-310, which is a range too broad to be reliable or accurate).
Since big slits increse the amount of light in the chamber and broaden the range, the interval at which the instrument should stop directing light on the detector depends on the slits. If we park the detector at 320 and shine light at 300 with slits 1,1 we will not see anything. If we employ slits such as 5,5, we will see the tail of the massive amount of light at 302, 303...
In addition, light of wavelength n undergoes geometric reflections at multiples of n, mainly n/2 and 2n. This means that if we look at whatever light is in the chamber at 500 nm (we park the detector so that only light at 500nm can generate a signal) and shine on the sample light at 250 nm, the detector will see a colossal 2n reflection, and thus receive a killer amount of light.

Emission experiments
We choose a specific interval of light from the lamp (320 nm), we shine it on the sample, and we collect whatever else comes out. If the sample is fluorescent, it will consume part of that light at 320 nm and emit some brand new light at higher wavelengths, such as in the range 360-420.

Park, which portion of the light from the lamp we want.
Of the more energetic wavelegths, only a couple: 250, 275
for the less energetic wavelengths, in the range 300-450 with incrementals of 10 nm
e.g. 250, 275, 300, 310, 320...

Slits (Ex,Em)
only some select combinations that proved to be the most common.
In Emission experiments, the two slits follow the rule Ex >= Em

1-1
2-1
2-1.
3-1
3-1.5
3-2
4-2
5-2
6-3
6-4

e.g. yes 3,1 but no 1,3

Range
It should be after the park, and proportionally tighter depending on the slits used. This is tuned by a "safety factor" S

from (Park)+(20*S*(sqrt(Em+Ex))) to (Park*2)-(20*S*(sqrt(Em+Ex)))

For slits 4 and lower, S is 0.6. For slits higher than 5, the factor should be 0.8

Excitation experiments
The concept is, we choose to focus the detector only on one specific wavelength that is generated by the sample (or sample produces light in the range 360-420, so we can choose to only gather light at 400). We then shine the sample with light at lower wavelengths (250-380) so we can see which wavelengths are "more efficient" at stimulating the fluorescence at 400.

Park
From 350 to 600 on a 10 nm increment
e.g. 350, 360, 370, 380...

Slits (Ex,Em)
Same combinations of Emission experiments but the two values are inverted.
In Excitation experiments, the two slits follow the rule Ex <= Em
e.g. if an Em measure is carried out with slits 3,1, the corresponding Ex measure will be carried out with slits 1,3.

Range
The range must start after the n/2 geometric reflecion of the park (the half value).
There is an S factor here as well, but it should be more severe. This is because the park is chosen to be in the region of the spectrum where the emitted light is more intense.
The range must end before the park itself, or we would see the n light from the lamp.

from (Park/2)+(20*S*(sqrt(Em+Ex))) to (Park)-(20*S*(sqrt(Em+Ex)))

For slits 4 and lower, S is 0.7. For slits higher than 5, the factor should be 0.9
-----

Integration time
This is the time that we give the instrument to collect photons. Higher integration times will allow us to have smoother curves.
For both Em and Ex experiments, integration time has to be 0.1, 0.5 and 1
0.1 is usually needed for quick scans to assess if the parameters are appropriate or if the sample is placed correctly. Then the same experiment is run with higher integration times to obtain good data.
-----

The experiments should be organized in folders according to the slits, because it's the first parameter to choose when you want to measure an unknown sample.
Since an Em experiment with slits 2,1 is usually followed by an Ex experiment with slits 1,2, Em and Ex experiments with the same slit values should be in the same folder, 2-1.
e.g. folder ''2-1'' contains all the Em experiments with slits 2_1 and all Ex experiments with slits 1_2

Given the large number of files, the experiments should be organized in three sub folders according to the integration time, called 0.1, 0.5, 1.

The single XML files are named according to the usual naming convention.
e.g. in folder ''1-2'' we will find three subfolders, but the single XML files will have names such as
Emission_250_1_2_0.1
Emission_250_1_2_0.5
Emission_250_1_2_1
Emission_260_1_2_0.1
Emission_260_1_2_0.5
Emission_260_1_2_1
...
Excitation_350_2_1_0.1
Excitation_350_2_1_0.5
Excitation_350_2_1_1
Excitation_360_2_1_0.1
Excitation_360_2_1_0.5
